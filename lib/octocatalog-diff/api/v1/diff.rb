      # This class represents a `diff` produced by a catalog-diff operation. This has traditionally
      # been stored as an array with:
      #   [0] Type of change - '+', '-', '!', '~'
      #   [1] Type, title, and maybe structure, delimited by "\f"
      #   [2] Content of the "old" catalog
      #   [3] Content of the "new" catalog
      #   [4] File and line of the "old" catalog
      #   [5] File and line of the "new" catalog
      # This object seeks to preserve this traditional structure, while providing methods to make it
      # easier to deal with. We recommend using the named options, rather than #raw or the indexed array,
      # as the raw object and indexed array are not guaranteed to be stable.
