# octocatalog-diff

#### Compile Puppet catalogs from 2 branches, versions, etc., and compare them <img src="/doc/images/octocatolog-diff-logo.png" align="right" height=126 width=240>

`octocatalog-diff` is a tool that enables developers to be more efficient when testing changes to Puppet manifests. It is most commonly used to display differences in Puppet catalogs between stable and development branches. It does not require a working Puppet master (or puppetserver), so it is often run by developers on their workstations and in Continuous Integration environments.

At GitHub, we manage thousands of nodes with a Puppet code base containing 500,000+ lines of code from over 200 contributors. We run `octocatalog-diff` thousands of times per day as part of Continuous Integration testing, and developers run it on their workstations as they are working with the code.

`octocatalog-diff` is written in Ruby and is distributed as a gem. It runs on Mac OS and Unix/Linux platforms.

It is under active development at this time. We suspect that with the initial release, some people who try it out could be using configurations of Puppet that we haven't experienced within our environment. We are eager to identify and fix as many of these as we can to expand the compatibility of this tool as much as possible.

## How?

Traditional Puppet development generally takes one of two forms. Frequently, developers will test changes by running a Puppet agent (perhaps in `--noop` mode) to see if the desired change has resulted on an actual system. Others will use formal testing methodologies, such as `rspec-puppet` or the beaker framework to validate Puppet code.

`octocatalog-diff` uses a different pattern. In its most common invocation, it compiles Puppet catalogs for both the stable branch (e.g. master) and the development branch, and then compares them. It filters out attributes or resources that have no effect on ultimate state of the target system (e.g. tags) and displays the remaining differences. Using this strategy, one can get feedback on changes without deploying Puppet code to a server and conducting a full Puppet run, and this tool works even if test coverage is incomplete.

There are some [limitations](doc/limitations.md) to a catalog-based approach, meaning it will never completely replace unit, integration, or deployment testing. However, it does provide substantial time savings in both the development and testing cycle. In this repository, we provide example scripts for using `octocatalog-diff` in development and CI environments.

`octocatalog-diff` is currently able to get catalogs by the following methods:
- Compile catalog via the command line with a Puppet agent on your machine (as GitHub uses the tool internally)
- Obtain catalog over the network from PuppetDB
- Obtain catalog over the network using the API to query a Puppet Master / PuppetServer (Puppet 3.x and 4.x supported)
- Read catalog from a JSON file

## Example

Here is simulated output from running `octocatalog-diff` to compare the Puppet catalog changes between the master branch and the Puppet code in the current working directory:

The example above reflects the changes in the Puppet catalog from switching an underlying device for a mounted file system.

## What's in a name?

During its original development at GitHub, this tool was simply called `catalog-diff`. However, there is already a [Puppet module with that name](https://forge.puppet.com/zack/catalog_diff) and we didn't want to create any confusion (in fact, a case could be made to use both approaches). So, we named the tool `octocatalog-diff` because who doesn't like the [octocat](https://octodex.github.com/)? Then one day in chat, someone referred to the tool as ":octocat:alog-diff", and that moniker caught on for electronic communication.
